#Operator : An operator is a special symbol that carries out an operation
#like example
print(3+4)
print(3.5+4.8)
print(56 * 55)
print(55//11)

#Concatenation
print("Shru"+"ti")
print("Shruti Pandey "  * 6)

print(10 + 55.57)
# If I write 5**3 it means 5 to power 3 that is 125
print(64**3)

#PEMDAS : Parentheses,Exponents,Multiplication,Division,Addition,Subtraction
# in this order we must solve the questions
print(34 + 45*3)
print((54 + 46)*45)

#Division ,Floor Division and the modulo operator
# This sign "/" gives values after decimal also like:
print(45/11)
# This sign "//" does not gives values with decimal points like:
print(45//11)

#Modulo-Operator "%" which means remainder which gives remainder value of the division part
print(45%11)
